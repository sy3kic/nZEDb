0.4.23 2015-07-06
Added:
	* Created a config directory under .../nzedb to contain configuration/settings files, so they are all together and don't need paths changing when code moves. I'll gradually move older config/settings files here, with some exceptions TBD.

		***NOTE*** this may slow things down for some users of *very* active groups.
		There is an entry in the Settings table (max=>headers=>iteration) to set the value (default 1,000,000), an entry in admin => Edit Site to make this easier will come when someone can be coerced into doing smarty work ;-)
